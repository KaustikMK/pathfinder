# beta 17
- Fix bug where export doesn't show up

# beta 1-16
- Initial Release
- geode index does not allow for link transfers without updating the entire mod (and therefore pushing a new update to everyone)
- this is not a new version. it is the same version. the geode index people do not like flexibility (?)
